Hamster Hotel 

This program is a website built off the prototype named "Hamster Hotel". It is an attemt to recreate it as closely as possible for desktop. Mobile phones and tablets should also be supported, however only the tablet version is complete.

10/30/23: Created the repository and basic file structure. 10/31/23: Added the header and some of the hero image code. 11/1/23: Built all the way down to the card section of the program. 11/2/23: Built out the rest of the website in desktop mode. 11/3/23: Modified some components to allow for easier responsiveness to tablet mode, and created the tablet mode. 

Peer review:  Jesus Lares - 3:59 - right off the bat probaby 90% close to the prototype, from what i can see maybe amenities needs to be smaller and packages thats maybe it from what i can see. is almost fully responsive.Awesome good job sebas!
